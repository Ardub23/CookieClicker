v1.1.5
– Previous auto-savescumming change now applies to both types of savescumming (JQB appearance and aging)
– Bugfix: Savescum loops no longer think a tick occurred when you change soil (changing soil now pauses the loops briefly)

v1.1.4
– Maybe made auto-savescumming set its restore point more reliably; probably didn't make things worse, at least
– Bugfix: No longer try to plant elderworts when there are queenbeets still in the way

v1.1.3
– Better handling of garden states with both JQBs and immature QBs (no longer flips GS on the assumption that QBs are ready to harvest if JQBs are present)

v1.1.2
– Removed debug console print statements
– Bugfix: No longer leaves golden switch on after harvesting queenbeets if elderworts are then planted
– Bugfix: Main loop no longer tries to run during savescum loop

v1.1.1
– Bugfix: Options menu warning for farm level < 3 no longer says "level 9"

== v1.1.0 ==
– Now works for farms of any level at least 3
– Added a warning about setting "# JQBs to scum growth for" to 4


v1.0.1
– Tweaked the options menu to match the style used by the vanilla options
– Bugfix: Now handles when CCSE erroneously(?) passes nothing to load() – no more odd behavior when importing a save

== v1.0.0 ==
– Compatibility with Cookie Clicker v2.031
– Nothing else changed, but I can't think of a reason to keep calling this a beta, so now it's an "official" release
– Should've done that back in 0.3 honestly


v0.4.3
– Compatibility with Cookie Clicker v2.029

v0.4.2
– Checks for mature JQBs earlier in the loop, so it should handle some fringe garden states better
– Bugfix: No longer turns golden switch on and off to harvest queenbeets when there are none

v0.4.1
– Bugfix: No longer turns golden switch on when harvesting queenbeets if 'Manage golden switch' is off

v0.4.0
– Started keeping a changelog finally
– Auto JQB now displays its status in the "Garden info" tooltip (above Seed Seek's list, if present)
– Added "Recommended settings" and "All settings OFF" buttons
– Bugfix: JQB growth scum count slider now takes effect immediately under all circumstances
