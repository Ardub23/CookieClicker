v1.0.1
– Tweaked the options menu to match the style used by the vanilla options
– Bugfix: Now handles when CCSE erroneously(?) passes nothing to load(); no more odd behavior when importing a save

== v1.0.0 ==
– Compatibility with Cookie Clicker v2.031
– Nothing else changed, but I can't think of a reason to keep calling this a beta, so now it's an "official" release
– Should've done that back in 0.3 honestly


v0.4.3
– Compatibility with Cookie Clicker v2.029

v0.4.2
– Checks for mature JQBs earlier in the loop, so it should handle some fringe garden states better
– Bugfix: No longer turns golden switch on and off to harvest queenbeets when there are none

v0.4.1
– Bugfix: No longer turns golden switch on when harvesting queenbeets if 'Manage golden switch' is off
